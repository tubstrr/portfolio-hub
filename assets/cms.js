<p>As you know by now, my name is Jonathan Knoll and I'm a software engineer with about a decade of experience; if you're interested, here's my full career journey.</p>
<p>It all started in fall of 2015 inside a Panera Bread; While I was working there as a bus boy I would day dream about what my future held.  I didn't know exactly where I was going, but I knew one thing for certain: I did not want to be at Panera forever. With that in mind I started looking for careers that would allow me to have the lifestyle I wanted.   I was split between learning how to be a forex trader, and a web developer.  Naturally, I started teaching myself both careers hoping one would take off. Thankfully web development took off!</p>
<p>In the summer of 2016 I had been teaching myself web development for a bit under a year; I realized I had zero experience applying or interviewing. In order to learn how to interview, I decided to go to a local agency and ask to speak to their hiring manager ðŸ˜…Little did I know the agency was the owner and one developer!  I ended up talking to the owner of the agency and by the end of the conversation he decided to take a chance on me and gave me a 2 week internship.  That internship turned into a part time position, which turned into four years and my first my first salary.   I think back to that season as an inverted college experience; where I was able to learn about the skills to work in the industry while getting paid.</p>
<p>After four years under my belt I tried to build my own agency.  I really cared about the local economy, and felt that there was an opportunity to build a new kind of agency.  One focused on local businesses, building relationships and focusing on delivering value rather than maximizing profits.  Turns out local businesses don't really want to take a chance on a 22 year old during a global pandemic. More than that though, I learned that I'm not cut out to run a business. The dream of being your own boss is enticing, however the reality of running a business is quite stressful.</p>
<p>Shortly after I closed the doors on my business I got hired at a proper agency in Chicago. Here I really learned the industry; I had the opportunity to work on many projects with many technologies, lead projects for fortune 500 companies, assemble unique tech stacks for each client, negotiate contracts, and lead a team of 7 developers. In my time there I was able to really hone my skills and I learned a lot; A lot about myself, a lot about teams, a lot about technology. My time at this agency came to a close when the agency imploded on itself; After a year of not winning any projects the agency was forced to lay off most of the staff. After a brief bout of unemployment I landed a job at another agency in Chicago and have been continuing to work there.</p>
